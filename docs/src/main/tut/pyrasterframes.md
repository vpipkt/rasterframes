# RasterFrames&nbsp;in&nbsp;Python

RasterFrames includes Python bindings for using the library from within [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html).
While creating Python documentation on parity with Scala is forthcoming, these resources should help 
in the meantime:

* [PyRasterFrames README](https://github.com/locationtech/rasterframes/blob/develop/pyrasterframes/python/README.rst)
* [PyRasterFrames Examples](https://github.com/locationtech/rasterframes/tree/develop/pyrasterframes/python/examples)
* [RasterFrames Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/locationtech/rasterframes/blob/develop/deployment/README.md)

Most features available in the Scala API are exposed in the Python API, and take almost the same form as they
do in Scala. Python UDFs on `Tile` are not yet supported. 

If there's a specific feature that appears to be missing in the Python version [please submit an issue](https://github.com/locationtech/rasterframes/issues)
so that we might address it for you.
